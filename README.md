# PictureSpanTask
creating a picture span task in lab.js with the help of Felix Henninger! Check out the lab.js site here:

Participants will complete immediate recall (IR), and delayed recall (15 s delay; DR), with order counterbalanced such that half receive IR-DR and the other half receive DR-IR.

Then they will be asked a strategy questionnaire (Inquiry), and will complete a final picture naming task with no delay, and one with delay (Point and Name; PN).

Children will receive two lists at each list length (2-5 items). Stimuli will be shown on the screen in an array, and will be highlighted one at a time. Then, children will have to point to each picture that was shown, in the order that they were shown.

The experimenter will record the pointing response with a mouse click on the picture. After each click, the picture that was selected will be greyed out.
