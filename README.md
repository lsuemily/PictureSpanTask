# PictureSpanTask
creating a picture span task in jsPsych
Plan to have a practice phase of picture naming to be certain children can correctly label all pictures (verbal reponse).
Participants will then complete immediate recall (IR), and delayed recall (15 s delay; DR), with order counterbalanced such that half receive IR-DR and the other half receive DR-IR.

Then they will be asked a strategy questionnaire (Inquiry), and will complete a final picture naming task with no delay, and one with delay (Point and Name; PN).

Children will receive one list at each list length (2-5 items). All stimuli will be shown on the screen, and the edge around the picture to-be-recalled will be highlighted temporarily. Then, children will have to point to each picture that was shown, in the order that they were shown.

The experimenter will record the pointing response with a mouse click on the picture.
